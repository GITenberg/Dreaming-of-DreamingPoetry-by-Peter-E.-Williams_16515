<P>I keep my job,<BR>

<P>Always the same old job,<BR>
  17 years of it.</P>

<P>Sheer luxury. </P>
<H2><A name=SHAME></A>Shame</H2>
<P>They got to me.</P>
<P>They drove me<BR>
  off the deep end.</P>
<P>But I&#8217;m lucky<BR>
  with my label,<BR>
  and my safe job.</P>
<P>Shame I&#8217;m nuts.<BR>

<P>Boil, boil, and<BR>

  that is my mind.</P>
<P>Ideas bob up,<BR>
  then quickly go.<BR>
  But some will stay<BR>
  and add to the<BR>
  flavour that is<BR>
  my twisted mind.</P>
<H2><A name=DREAMING></A>Dreaming of dreaming with my cat.</H2>
<P>(Dedicated to Go the cat)</P>
<P>Early this morning in bed,<BR>
  I had a very pleasant dream.</P>
<P>I dreamt that I was asleep<BR>
  on the sofa<BR>
  with my cat<BR>
  (that I don&#8217;t have anymore)<BR>
  curled up on my back,<BR>
  and we were both<BR>
  warm and happy.</P>
<P>Those types of dreams<BR>
  are always the best<BR>
  and I never want <BR>
  to wake up from them.</P>
<P>But then again&#8230;<BR>
  I&#8217;d never get to<BR>
  see the beautiful day<BR>
  in store for me.</P>
<H2><A name=PIFFLE></A>Piffle the Cat</H2>
<P>My cat came to me in a dream last night,<BR>
  he needed my love and my reassurance<BR>
  that things would be okay.</P>
<P>His name was Patches,<BR>
  but he answered to Piffle<BR>
  and he was a sook and a cuddler.</P>
<P>My cat came to me in a dream last night,<BR>
  he never deserved to go<BR>
  the way that he did.<BR>
  no-one did.<BR>
  you see, he was killed by vicious dogs<BR>
  at the front door of his home</P>
<P>He never did learn to fight<BR>
  only to run<BR>
  But he wasn&#8217;t fast enough that day,<BR>
  he was getting a little old.</P>
<P>My cat came to me in a dream last night,<BR>
  I told him I loved him and he told me the same,<BR>
  for it was twenty years ago<BR>
  that he was taken away<BR>
  to the very day.</P>
<H2><A name=MYMUM></A>My Mum</H2>
<P>I love my Mum,<BR>
  I always do,<BR>
  always have,<BR>
  always will.</P>
<P>She&#8217;s always joining dots,<BR>
  but never quite<BR>
  getting the picture.</P>
<P>So we&#8217;re always <BR>
  drawing those pictures,<BR>
  Dad and me.</P>
<P>Framing them,<BR>
  and hanging them <BR>
  on the walls,<BR>
  for Mum to see.</P>
<P>I love Mum!<BR>
  Everybody does.<BR>
  She&#8217;s such a <BR>
  loving, lovable, caring<BR>
  and wonderful human being.<BR>
  God, I love her.</P>
<H2><A name=WHITESPACE></A>White Space</H2>
<P>Here I sit,<BR>
  at my word pro,</P>
<P>the white space<BR>
  staring me down,<BR>
  but not out.</P>
<P>I experiment,<BR>
  juxtaposing<BR>
  pseudo-random words<BR>
  into pretentious,<BR>
  premeditated<BR>
  poetry.</P>
<P>Then with an afflatus,<BR>
  words flow,<BR>
  whispered by my muse,<BR>
  into lines and stanzas.</P>
<H2><A name=LIFE></A>Life&#8217;s A Beach</H2>
<P>I am not you.<BR>
  You are not me.<BR>
  Me, myself and I will get alone just fine.<BR>
  Fine for that is life.<BR>
  Life in the suburbs is sedate.<BR>
  Sedated in the psych. wards.<BR>
  Wardrobe looks a little bare.<BR>
  Bare all at the beach.</P>

<H2><A name=MILLION></A>A million to hate</H2>
<P>how many men could I find to hate ???<BR>
  how many have betrayed me ???<BR>
  10, 100, 1000 <BR>
  or a million times more</P>
<P>It&#8217;s just how you look at it;<BR>
&#8217;cos if you don&#8217;t have the time <BR>
  or the energy to hate<BR>
  then you will find true peace<BR>
  if only you look inside.</P>
<H2><A name=TOHAVELIVED></A>To have lived our fantasies</H2>
<P><BR>

  but you delivered nothing</P>
<P>had you really promised without thinking ???<BR>
  or did your feet turn cold ???</P>
<H2><A name=EXPLETIVES></A>And the Expletives Remained</H2>
<P>The lines flowed,<BR>
  the poem wrote itself<BR>
  and the expletives remained</P>
<P>Fuck the Poetry Police!<BR>
  Fuck you all, very much.</P>
<H2><A name=SPINNING></A>Spinning Out</H2>
<P>The last time I was <BR>
" hearing voices" again <BR>
  was only a couple of days ago. <BR>
  I was sick in bed <BR>
  with a viral infection. <BR>
  I was trying to sleep <BR>
  but voices kept saying <BR>
" Think what you know is true." </P>
<P>But then I would think, <BR>
" Well what do I know is the truth ?" </P>
<P>Then I&#8217;d think of something <BR>
  and say, well that&#8217;s true, <BR>
  and quick as a flash <BR>
  another voice would say <BR>
" Is that really what you believe ? <BR>
  Is that what is true ? <BR>
  Isn&#8217;t that bullshit ?" </P>
<P>And then I&#8217;d have to think of <BR>
  something else to believe in.</P>
<P>And this was not a relaxed process. <BR>
  No way! <BR>
  It was manic. </P>
<P>It seemed to happen <BR>
  a 1000 times a minute, <BR>
  and it just wouldn&#8217;t stop. </P>
<P>At least, it went on <BR>
  for an hour or so, <BR>
  and it seemed like an eternity.</P>
<P>Just another day <BR>
  in the life of <BR>
"a person with schizophrenia."</P>
<H2><A name=WALLS></A>Walls &amp; Sledge Hammers</H2>
<P>Where do I start ?<BR>
  At the beginning of course,<BR>
  but where is that exactly ?<BR>
  I am <BR>
  (to state it in <BR>
  politically incorrectly language)<BR>
  a schizophrenic.</P>
<P>And I have been living<BR>
  with that label<BR>
  for the past 15-odd years now. </P>
<P>I live by myself, <BR>
  have a few close friends&#8230; </P>
<P>But I count myself as <BR>
  one of the lucky ones <BR>
  because throughout all of times <BR>
  in and out of <BR>
  psych. wards of hospitals, </P>
<P>I kept the same job, <BR>
  with a large <BR>
  government organization, </P>
<P>and they&#8217;ve been very <BR>
  supportive towards me. </P>
<P>Today, at work, <BR>
  in my lucky full time job <BR>
  as a government nobody, <BR>
  I get largely left alone and <BR>
  to my own devices. </P>
<P>For better or for worse, <BR>
  but always with an occasional <BR>
  supervisory peer <BR>
  over my shoulder <BR>
  to keep me in line. </P>
<P>"Oh yes, &lt;Fred&gt;, <BR>
  your job is safe, <BR>
  we do value your work, <BR>
  just keep going <BR>
  at your own pace. </P>
<P>We&#8217;re not too sure <BR>
  where or <BR>
  how exactly you fit in, </P>
<P>but we like <BR>
  having you around, <BR>
  and, hey, <BR>
  somebody has to <BR>
  do the odd jobs, <BR>
  and we think you&#8217;re <BR>
  just the man."</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>Alas,<BR>
  I am not lucky enough <BR>
  to have a job that I&#8217;m in love with. </P>
<P>My career is not my life. </P>
<P>Sometimes I think that <BR>
  I&#8217;m just a tiny cog <BR>
  in a ridiculously enormous machine -<BR>
  but there are also moments <BR>
  when keeping that cog turning <BR>
  seems to make a (slight) difference. </P>
<P>I have good days <BR>
  and other days. </P>
<P>Sometimes the other days get ugly. </P>
<P><i>But</i>, I always try to do<BR>
  the right things at work, <BR>
  for recognition perhaps, <BR>
  or perhaps simply <BR>
  to prove that I am really <BR>
  not incompetent at my job. </P>
<P>I can do it well, <BR>
  and I do it the best <BR>
  of my capabilities. </P>
<P>And if that means that <BR>
  I hit brick walls then <BR>
  so be it - </P>
<P>I just have to get help <BR>
  when I hit one. <BR>
  I have learnt <BR>
  through bitter experience, <BR>
  that when I hit a wall, <BR>
  they will almost always out-stare me. </P>
<P>So that&#8217;s when I get a ladder, <BR>
  or maybe a sledge hammer.</P>
<H2><A name=KNOTS></A>Knots</H2>
<P>(Dedicated to Mistress Alexis)</P>
<P>I am naked,<BR>
  assume the position.<BR>
  I know it well.</P>
<P>She grabs her rope.<BR>
  Around it goes.<BR>
  Through my arms<BR>
  and around again,</P>
<P>knotted then back.<BR>
" Keep still, please."</P>
<P>and through again,<BR>
  and back around,<BR>
  again and again,<BR>
  and tied off in <BR>
  a love knot.</P>
<P>She double-checks<BR>
  the bondage.<BR>
  Finally she is satisfied<BR>
  with my helplessness.</P>
<P>Then she leaves me alone.<BR>
  I struggle a little.<BR>
  It is hopeless.<BR>
  I am helpless,<BR>
  totally!</P>
<P>I move around a little,<BR>
  trying to become comfortable.</P>
<P>The ropes bite in.<BR>
  Time passes,<BR>
  Hands become numb.<BR>
  The clock ticks on.<BR>
  I lose track of time,</P>
<P>it goes so slowly,<BR>
  how much longer will<BR>
  she make me wait ?</P>
<P>More time passes.<BR>
  Eventually she comes back.<BR>
  Soon I will have freedom,<BR>
  but not before we<BR>
  have played some more.</P>
<P>Oh, the agony.<BR>
  Oh, the ecstasy.<BR>
  I truly love it.</P>
<P>I can&#8217;t wait for my freedom,<BR>
  then to do it all again.</P>
<H2><A name=HESFALLEN></A>"He&#8217;s fallen in the water!"</H2>
<P><BR>
  Ying tong tiddle high poe<BR>
  and other shades of Goonism<BR>
  drifting in and out<BR>
  of the corners of my mind<BR>
  reminiscing about those</P>
<P>hazy radio days<BR>
  crazy voices reverberating<BR>
  around the room<BR>
  antics of Milligan and co.<BR>
  amazing, surprising,</P>
<P>entertaining,<BR>
  delighting,<BR>
  always echoing</P>
<H2><A name=VOICES></A>Voices again. <BR>
  Been there, done that...</H2>
<P>I can still vividly remember <BR>
  the last time that I was "hearing voices" <BR>
  (to use a worn out metaphor). </P>
<P>It was less that a week ago. <BR>
  I had been there a thousand times before. </P>
<P>Yes, I am on medication. <BR>
  Yes, I do take it regularly. </P>
<P>But this was only <BR>
  a short lived episode. </P>
<P>It was a Saturday, and <BR>
  I hadn&#8217;t gotten dressed all day, <BR>
  but instead I had <BR>
  been napping off and on all day. </P>
<P>I had also done my weeks washing and <BR>
  had it drying on a clothes horse <BR>
  in the lounge room <BR>
  (as is normal, being winter). </P>
<P>It was early evening and <BR>
  I wanted to go to sleep. </P>
<P>Slumber was a blissful escape, <BR>
  or perhaps only sometimes. </P>
<P>Anyway, I couldn&#8217;t get any sleep, <BR>
  and my mind was racing. </P>
<P>"Everyone&#8217;s going to find out <BR>
  all about those secrets. </P>
<P>Everyone will know the <BR>
  worst things that I can imagine. </P>
<P>They will know all about me <BR>
  and everything that I imagined <BR>
  people saying will be true now." </P>
<P>They keep on going around in my head. </P>
<P>They&#8217;re crap, <BR>
  and I know it. <BR>
  They&#8217;re just voices, <BR>
  I tell myself, <BR>
  but why won&#8217;t they go away ? <BR>
  A short time passed. <BR>
  More voices, <BR>
  different voices, </P>
<P>"You know what to do, <BR>
  Mother always says so. <BR>
  What should I do now ? <BR>
  I don&#8217;t know! <BR>
  But you know what to do, <BR>
  don&#8217;t you ?" </P>
<P>The vicious circle kept going &#8216;round. </P>
<P>***</P>
<P>Time to get up from bed and <BR>
  ring Mum, <BR>
  after all <BR>
  she knows what to do. </P>
<P>Scattered and shaking, <BR>
  I do this. </P>
<P>I go to the phone, <BR>
  sit down, and <BR>
  phone ever-reliable Mum. </P>
<P>She is my tower of strength. </P>
<P>It&#8217;s an STD call <BR>
  but I don&#8217;t care. </P>
<P>She tells me to ring the Crisis Team <BR>
  (aka the Mental Health Triage) <BR>
  but I can only fumble with <BR>
  my electronic organizer. </P>
<P>I know exactly how it works, <BR>
  inside and out, <BR>
  but I could not operate it to save myself. </P>
<P>I get a pen and Mum tells me <BR>
  the phone number of the crisis team and <BR>
  I write it down. </P>
<P>She tells me that <BR>
  she can be on the next bus <BR>
  if I need her to be with me. </P>
<P>I tell her "no thanks, <BR>
  I think I&#8217;ll be OK". <BR>
  I hang up the phone and <BR>
  call the Crisis Team. </P>
<P>I speak to a lady who knows me, <BR>
  although I cannot recall her. </P>
<P>She talks me through it and <BR>
  tells me to watch a bit of TV or <BR>
  listen to some music and <BR>
  to occupy myself until <BR>
  later in the night. </P>
<P>My mini-crisis passes <BR>
  as I follow this advice throughout the night. </P>
<P>Was it because I did all of <BR>
  the "right things" or <BR>
  was it simply that my "medication" <BR>
  was taking effect ?</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>The above episode <BR>
  was only a small tremor, <BR>
  but it still scared me a bit. </P>
<P>I guess that I took it better <BR>
  than I otherwise might have <BR>
  because I have been there before <BR>
  and done it all before. </P>
<P>But that doesn&#8217;t make it <BR>
  any less scary at the time. <BR>
  It&#8217;s only with the benefit of hindsight <BR>
  that I can see that I could cope with it.</P>

<P>It doesn&#8217;t happen to me either!<BR>
  Life is not a fairy tale.</P>
<P>And yet love will happen.<BR>
  Of that I&#8217;m sure.</P>
<H2><A name=AREWETHERE></A>Are we there yet ?</H2>
<P>Here we go&#8230;<BR>
  on a fantastic journey<BR>
  of self discovery.</P>
<P>He told me:<BR>
" Just grab a pen<BR>
  and write whatever you feel.<BR>
  Let it flow.<BR>
  It&#8217;s best <BR>
  when you don&#8217;t<BR>
  premeditate your writing."</P>
<P>I should:<BR>
  edit my writing, <BR>
  not my ideas !</P>
<P>I should: <BR>
  take my own advice.</P>
<P>But, I think,<BR>
  that&#8217;s easier said than done.<BR>
  Don&#8217;t I always try to think <BR>
  of what I&#8217;m going to say next, <BR>
  before I commit it to paper ?</P>
<P>But then I think,<BR>
" What is good writing anyway ?<BR>
  How will I know when I&#8217;m there ?"</P>
<P>"Are we there yet ?"</P>
<H2><A name=ITDIDNT></A>It didn&#8217;t really happen</H2>
<P>You went down the street<BR>
  just an ordinary day</P>
<P>you saw a young girl<BR>
  innocent and sweet<BR>
  talking to her dad<BR>
  about everyday stuff</P>
<P>their freezer needed defrosting<BR>
  happens everyday</P>
<P>did you really tell her<BR>
  or did you just dream it<BR>
  how to make a little&#8230; tiny&#8230; flame thrower ???</P>
<P><I>of course you didn&#8217;t !!!<BR>
  you&#8217;re not that stupid,<BR>
  and even if you did<BR>
  you weren&#8217;t serious.<BR>
  she&#8217;d know that.</I></P>
<P>you&#8217;d never even tried <BR>
  to make one yourself<BR>
  but you&#8217;d heard it somewhere&#8230;<BR>
  that you can make one<BR>
  from an aerosol can and a flame</P>
<P>and she could even reach that freezer<BR>
  if she just stands on a chair</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>try telling her parents<BR>
  try telling <B>her<BR>
  </B>you weren&#8217;t serious<BR>
  you didn&#8217;t even know<BR>
  if it would work</P>
<P>try living with the memory of that scared little face<BR>
  all covered with bandages<BR>
  never the same again</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>but don&#8217;t worry <BR>
  it was just a dream<BR>
  it didn&#8217;t really happen at all, did it ?</P>
<P>just keep telling yourself <BR>
  it was all just a bad, bad dream.</P>
<H2><A name=LOVELY></A>Lovely Passenger</H2>
<P>Here I sit,<BR>

  a vision divine.</P>
<P>She is young<BR>

  But mostly she is<BR>
  a nubile,<BR>
  young thing.</P>
<P>She looks<BR>
  a little tired,<BR>

<P>She sneezes.<BR>
  Will I say<BR>
" Bless you" ?<BR>
  Perhaps not.</P>
<P>Oh, I pine for<BR>

<P>This morning, <BR>

<P>She was very attractive, <BR>
  I recall from <BR>
  my two second glance.</P>
<P>lovely face,<BR>
  and such nice,<BR>
  long, black hair.</P>
<P>and did I crave for her ?<BR>

<H2><A name=FROM></A>From Attitude to Gratitude</H2>
<P>No longer do I have <BR>
  the sheer luxury of <BR>
  a do nothing, <BR>
  be nobody, <BR>
  go nowhere job. </P>
<P>It&#8217;s good to have some real work to do. <BR>
  But now, of course, <BR>
  I have to work with <BR>
  crappy computers and <BR>
  a card file system that <BR>
  have stood still in time. </P>
<P>As the world evolved <BR>
  and got ready for <BR>
  the next millenium, <BR>
  we are stuck here in <BR>
  a 70s time warp <BR>
  with nothing but <BR>
  dusty old shelves <BR>
  and compactii <BR>
  and junk <BR>
  that belongs in a museum <BR>
  to work with.</P>
<P>And still, <BR>
  to get results <BR>
  with antique systems <BR>
  can give me <BR>
  a feeling of self worth.</P>
<P>I do indeed lead a lucky life. <BR>
  After all, I have a job <BR>
  (with good conditions <BR>
  and people too). </P>
<P>I keep my job, <BR>
  and try my darndest <BR>
  to do a good and honest job. <BR>
  Because that is what <BR>
  makes life worth living. </P>
<P>Good friends, <BR>
  family, <BR>
  co-workers, <BR>
  and the satisfaction <BR>
  of knowing that I will live <BR>
  to enjoy life another day.</P>
<H2><A name=PERHAPS></A>Perhaps</H2>
<P>Do I believe in God ?<BR>
  That depends on what you mean by God.</P>
<P>Do I believe in life after death ?<BR>
  That depends how you define life,<BR>
  how you define existence.</P>
<P>Do I have a soul ?<BR>
  I don&#8217;t know how you define a soul,<BR>
  but I suspect that I do.</P>
<P>I believe that there is something to look forward to<BR>
  after death.</P>
<P>I believe that in some way, in some "place" the <BR>
  souls of "good men" end up and exist together.</P>
<P>I don&#8217;t know what or where it is,<BR>
  But I'm looking forward to it - one day,<BR>
  one eternity - perhaps.</P>
<H2><A name=REMEMBERED></A>Remembered Turf</H2>
<P>I&#8217;ve got the password<BR>
  and I&#8217;m into the system.</P>
<P>It&#8217;s precipitating wet stuff<BR>
  out of the sky,<BR>
  but I&#8217;m warm and<BR>
  dry in here.</P>
<P>And tiM was blown away<BR>
  by his wet suit,<BR>
  the other day at the coast&#8230;</P>
<P>And now I&#8217;m just listening<BR>
  to some jazzy kind of music,<BR>
  playing on the stereo,</P>
<P>as we remember the amazing<BR>
  turf sculptures<BR>
  in Civic,<BR>
  in some abandoned<BR>
  bank office building,<BR>
  now reclaimed as art space<BR>
  for the common man.</P>
<H2><A name=ONETUESDAY></A>One Tuesday in February</H2>
<P>It&#8217;s a beautiful day to be alive!<BR>
  I have just stepped outside the building<BR>
  on my lunch break <BR>
  with a can of Coca-Cola <BR>
  and now I can quietly relax <BR>
  and enjoy sitting on a bench <BR>
  in the sunshine and sit <BR>
  and quietly sip on my drink. </P>
<P>The quietness is interrupted <BR>
  by a helicopter flying overhead <BR>
  for a moment. </P>
<P>A few more sips <BR>
  and the caffeine <BR>
  and chemical cocktail <BR>
  begins to work, <BR>
  to give me a "rush" <BR>
&#8211; or perhaps just a nudge.</P>
<P>One quick ten minute walk <BR>
  around the buildings <BR>
  and I&#8217;m half way <BR>
  back to my building. </P>
<P>I&#8217;m a little puffed <BR>
  but feeling good. <BR>
  Better start heading back <BR>
  to my office soon.</P>
<H2><A name=ONEWEDNESDAY></A>One Wednesday in March</H2>
<P>I walk outside into the glorious day.<BR>
  The sun shines brightly,<BR>
  another lunch time,<BR>
  another can of coke.</P>
<P>Sweet as honey.<BR>
  Sickly sweet.<BR>
  I find time to sit<BR>
  in the shade,<BR>
  enjoy the beautiful day<BR>
  and sip the sweet nectar.</P>
<P>Such a change from<BR>
  the stuffy offices &#8211; <BR>
  air conditioned and<BR>
  closed and<BR>
  controlled climate.</P>
<H2><A name=MYBROTHER></A>My Brother. Oh brother...</H2>
<P>I have a brother <BR>
  who thinks that he understands <BR>
  all about my condition. </P>
<P>But, deep down <BR>
  I think that <BR>
  he thinks that <BR>
  my condition is <BR>
  all caused by a combination of: </P>
<P>low self-esteem, <BR>
  not thinking positively, <BR>
  bad diet, and <BR>
  a guilty conscience </P>
<P>(presumably about either <BR>
  not working hard enough, <BR>
  seeing prostitutes, or <BR>
  forgetting birthdays, or <BR>
  some crap like that). </P>
<P>He has lots of good intentions <BR>
  but basically he can&#8217;t <BR>
  come to terms with <BR>
  the fact that <BR>
  I earn a good salary <BR>
  (not unlike him) </P>
<P>but I spend all my money <BR>
  (basically on myself) <BR>
  with not much to show for it, <BR>
  and he has a wife and <BR>
  four kids to support. </P>
<P>If I mention on the phone <BR>
  that I have to go down the street <BR>
  to buy a few groceries, <BR>
  then he will gladly spend <BR>
  half an hour telling me about <BR>
  his favourite recipe, and <BR>
  what ingredients to buy to make it <BR>
  (and how good it will be for me) - <BR>
  even though I tell him that <BR>
  I could not be less interested in his recipe.</P>
<P>Oh brother!</P>
<H2><A name=RELIGION></A>Religion, sex, etc.</H2>
<P>I have some &#8230; <BR>
  shall I say <BR>
  unconventional views on religion. </P>
<P>I was touched by a Christian "anecdote", <BR>
  for lack of a better thing to call it, <BR>
  where, the story goes <BR>
  that a man talks to god and <BR>
  says (basically) </P>
<P>"throughout my life <BR>
  I have been walking along a beach, <BR>
  and I saw two sets of footprints, <BR>
  yours and mine. </P>
<P>But in the worst times of my life <BR>
  I only saw one set of footprints. </P>
<P>Why did you abandon me God ?" <BR>
  And God replies <BR>
" At those times, <BR>
  I had not abandoned you, <BR>
  I was carrying you! </P>
<P>You see I never abandoned you, <BR>
  I was always there for you." </P>
<P>That story always gets me right <I>there</I>.</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>But basically <BR>
  I don&#8217;t call myself a Christian. </P>
<P>I don&#8217;t know if I believe in God, <BR>
  but I believe that <BR>
  there must be something after death. </P>
<P>I believe that the souls of good people <BR>
  end up in some kind of eternity, </P>
<P>I would not exactly describe it as heaven, <BR>
  in the Christian definition.</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>I believe that the Bible lays out <BR>
  some very good ideals of how to live <BR>
  and how people should <BR>
  live by being "nice" to each other <BR>
  and so on, </P>
<P>but ultimately, <BR>
  I guess I just don&#8217;t buy all of that <BR>
  fire and brimstone stuff, <BR>
  and miracles left, right and centre. </P>
<P>I even found out a <BR>
  little bit about Buddhism, <BR>
  and liked some of the <BR>
  stuff I found out, <BR>
  until I found out that they have, <BR>
  shall we say, <BR>
  very strict views on <BR>
  sexually and <BR>
  what is sexually "proper" <BR>
  (for the lack of another word).</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>My sex life is <BR>
  what I call normal, <BR>
  if only slightly kinky. </P>
<P>I have a friend who I have an arrangement <BR>
  to see when the want arises. <BR>
  She is a prostitute and <BR>
  one of my best friends. </P>
<P>She keeps telling me <BR>
  that I am very special to her. </P>
<P>We are not exactly straight-laced <BR>
  (neither of us), <BR>
  but we know what we are doing and <BR>
  we are both consenting adults and <BR>
  that&#8217;s really all that needs to be said.</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>In the past I have been <BR>
  betrayed by people, <BR>
  workmates, <BR>
  who I once trusted - </P>
<P>all in the name of <BR>
  playing a practical joke, <BR>
  to humiliate and <BR>
  embarrass me about my private life. </P>
<P>I don&#8217;t like what they did to me, <BR>
  but I don&#8217;t despise them for it either. <BR>
  (I don&#8217;t have the time or <BR>
  energy to hate people). </P>
<P>I think that their actions only go <BR>
  to prove just how shallow <BR>
  they really are. </P>
<P>I don&#8217;t work with these <BR>
  people any more <BR>
  (because they have moved on to other jobs).</P>
<H2><A name=POKIES></A>Pokies</H2>
<P>Here I am again<BR>

<P>Came for lunch,<BR>
  stayed for a beer,<BR>
  and to play <BR>
  the one-armed bandits.</P>
<P>The victory jingles<BR>
  of many machines<BR>
  are deafening,<BR>
  but they are not <BR>
  playing for me.</P>
<P>So many times,<BR>
  one off that<BR>

<P>Better to stop now<BR>

<H2><a name="WIL2"></a>What is love ? #2</H2>
<P>"Love is a many splendid thing."<BR>
  that&#8217;s what someone said,<BR>
  but don&#8217;t ask me who.</P>
<P>Love is different things<BR>
  for different people,</P>
<P>but for me,<BR>
  love is about <BR>
  being there <BR>
  for someone special, <BR>
  and about them <BR>
  being there for me too.</P>
<P>I love my Mum &amp; Dad,<BR>
  and yes, my brother too,<BR>
  and all his family,<BR>
  and all my other relatives,</P>
<P>all my close friends,<BR>
  and the other ones too,<BR>
  who I only see now and then,</P>
<P>I love Annie on 2XX,<BR>
  who I&#8217;ve never even met,<BR>
  who just talks away <BR>
  to me on the radio,<BR>
  happy as can be, <BR>
  brightening up my morning.</P>
<P>I love: <BR>
  rock stars, <BR>
  pop stars, <BR>
  movie stars, <BR>
  and lots of people <BR>
  who I will never even know, <BR>
  except through their publicity machines,</P>
<P>yet if you asked me, <BR>
  I&#8217;d say,<BR>
" Sure, I love: <BR>
  Shania, <BR>
  Alanis, <BR>
  Pamela, <BR>
  and Kim Hope too"</P>
<P>and so many more, <BR>
  whose names escape me, <BR>
  leaving me with <BR>
  only fleeting images,<BR>
  from movies, TV, and magazines.</P>
<P>I love happy people,<BR>
  and struggling souls,<BR>
  and down-and-outs,<BR>
  and just about everyone!</P>
<P>I love beautiful people,<BR>
  and the rest too,<BR>
  because beauty isn&#8217;t about<BR>
  size or shape,<BR>
  it&#8217;s about what&#8217;s inside,<BR>
  and what you think and do.</P>
<P>But I don&#8217;t have<BR>
  <I><B>someone</B></I> special in my life.<BR>
  A lover, <BR>
  to love, <BR>
  and be loved by, <BR>
  <I>passionately,<BR>
  sexually, <BR>
  sensually!</I></P>
<P>so instead I dream on, <BR>
  just loving life itself.</P>
<P>And yes, I go on loving <BR>
  those girls <BR>
  from bordellos too,<BR>
  just occasionally. </P>
<P><I>Hey</I>, I&#8217;m only human,<BR>
  and I need loving too. <BR>
  Or is that just sex &amp; lust ?</P>
<P>I need loving,</P>
<P>I need love,</P>
<P>I love loving,</P>
<P>but don&#8217;t ask me<BR>
  what love is.</P>
<H2><A name=ABOUT></A>About the Poet</H2>
<P>Peter Eric Williams was born on 1st of November, 1961, in Adelaide, South
  Australia, and grew up in places which include: Adelaide, Berri, Sydney, Oro
  Bay (Papua), Sydney (again), Canberra, Penang Island (Malaysia); before then
  returning with his family to Canberra, where he finished primary school, then
  High School and College, living in Lyneham. He then got a job with the Department
  of Defence, as a Trainee Draftsman, just before turning 20, where he continues
  to work to date (currently 1999), as a Technical Officer.</P>
<P>He has only recently taken up writing poetry. When he enrolled in a poetry
  workshop last year, with the ACT Writers&#8217; Centre, he needed to bring
  a sample of his own poetry to the workshop, and he didn&#8217;t have any, so
  he wrote the poem which became "Nuts" (in a shortened form) in the evening
  before the workshop. It was warmly received in the workshop, and thus the germ
  of his poetry writing was planted and grew. He continues to share his poetry
  with fellow poets at the Closet Poets, who meet twice a month at the ACT Writers&#8217; Centre,
  and also occassionally performs his work on radio 2XX.</P>
<P>Peter was diagnosed as a Schizophrenic approximately 15 years ago, and now
  leads a relatively "normal" life, with his full-time job, and on continual
  anti-psychotic medication. He lives in a rented, two bedroom flat in the Canberra
  suburb of Hawker, where in his spare time he uses his personal computer for
  the internet, programming and of course, writing poetry and publishing it on
  his own personal web page.</P>
<P>A large section of Peter&#8217;s poetry appears on his personal home page
  ( <A
href="http://members.fortunecity.com/pew">http://members.fortunecity.com/pew</A> ).
  Some of Peter&#8217;s poetry currently appears on internet web site "The Australian
  BDSM Information Site" ( <a href="http://www.ozabis.info/stories_poetry.html">http://www.ozabis.info/stories_poetry.html</a> ),
  in the "short stories and poetry" section.</P>
<P>Peter said, "I hope that this poetry will: amuse, bemuse, entice, entertain,
  delight, shock, inform, educate and inspire the readers of these pages." Read
  this book and you will discover some of the quirky corners of his mind, about
  what turns him on, turns him off, and what turns him a little crazy&#8230; </P>

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on
the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use
imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the
beginning of this work.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
